##WARNING: when I made this only god and myself knew how it works... now only god knows please consult the OMNISIAH thank you.


Grenada Is a very simple file manager made in haskell using CLI.. its.. well really bad but I made it so I use it and I hope you will give it a chance... 

Its under construction so there might be better versions later on but for now its nothing special. And sidenote whilst this is under the ISC liscense I have modified it to make charged distribution against the rights provided in the liscence. side sidenote while you can modify it please do consider merging into the main repo to make this software better for all the other users.

If this software doesn't work change the version in Grenada.cabal from what it is to 4.17.2.1 and it should compile fine.
